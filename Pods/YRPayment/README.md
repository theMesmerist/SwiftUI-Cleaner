## üé® Customization : (more features are coming soon)

### üí≥ Customizing the credit card type (Symbole):

you can specify the symbole you want from the available types:
```swift
let card = YRPaymentCreditCard(type: .masterCard)
```
or specify a custom one by uploading your own image symbole:
```swift
let image = UIImage(named: "mySymboleImage")!
let card = YRPaymentCreditCard(type: .custom(image))
```
